When we commenced the Sanjay Ghodawat Institutes, we wanted to foray in the Education sector and make a mark on the educational map of the Nation by providing the best of educational facilities to our students and stakeholders. Today Sanjay Ghodawat Institutes has evolved as Sanjay Ghodawat University after its successful streak in the education field for the last 8 years. The vision of our Chairman is crystal clear to be reckoned among top educational institutes of the globe in coming years.<br/><br/>

                            It is with this vision that we are all marching towards attaining our goals. From successful institute to successful university that is where we want to head to. Accommodating students from all across the nation plus from other countries, giving them best of the educational environment and facilities, giving them a chance to rediscover their true selves so that they emerge as better human beings who go out and make an impact; that is our mission.<br/><br/>

                            As our stakeholders and students have always given us wonderful response in the past, we hope to better ourselves to be worthy of their trust in us. We believe that we will continue through the University to serve a larger number of students with varied choices in the coming years. I appeal to all of you to continue with your love and trust for the Sanjay Ghodawat University.<br/><br/>
